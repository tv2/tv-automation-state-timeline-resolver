This is a part of the [**Sofie** TV News Studio Automation System](https://github.com/nrkno/Sofie-TV-automation/).

## Abstract

This library orchestrates and controls different devices.
Its input is a [timeline](https://github.com/SuperFlyTV/supertimeline) data structure and a layer-to-device-map.
Using the input, it resolves the expected state, diffs the state against current state and sends commands to devices where necessary.

## Supported devices

- **[CasparCG](http://casparcg.com/)** - using the [casparcg-connection](https://github.com/SuperFlyTV/casparcg-connection) library
- **Blackmagic Design ATEM** vision mixers - using the [atem-connection](https://github.com/nrkno/tv-automation-atem-connection) library
- **Blackmagic Design Hyperdeck** record/playback devices - using the [hyperdeck-connection](https://github.com/nrkno/tv-automation-hyperdeck-connection) library
- **Lawo** audio mixers - using the [emberplus](https://github.com/nrkno/tv-automation-emberplus-connection) library
- **[OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)** live video production software
- **Panasoniz PTZ** cameras
- **Pharos** light control devices
- **[Sisyfos](https://github.com/olzzon/sisyfos-audio-controller)** audio controller
- **Quantel** video server
- **[vMix](https://www.vmix.com/)** software vision mixer
- **VizRT MediaSequencer** graphics system - using the [v-connection](https://github.com/tv2/v-connection) library
- Arbitrary [OSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control) compatible devices
- Arbitrary HTTP (REST) compatible devices
- Arbitrary TCP-socket compatible devices

## Installation and Usage

This is a mono-repo containing the TSR library, and a separate typings-only library ([timeline-state-resolver-types](/packages/timeline-state-resolver-types)).
Contrary to what your editor might say, the typings-only library cannot use dependencies from the main library.

Check the main [timeline-state-resolver](/packages/timeline-state-resolver) package for instructions on using the library and more information

## Development

When creating features that span the timeline-state-resolver and timeline-state-resolver-types packages - such as when creating a PR for supporting a new device - you will need to link the two packages together. To do that, after checking out a branch run:

```
yarn
yarn lerna link
```

This will link the types package to the main library so that you can use your new type definitions during development.

Note, that your IDE may not pick up your new type definitions until you build the types package.

There is a test application [quick-tsr](/packages/quick-tsr) inside this repository which can be used to easily test changes made to this library.

### Working with types

Types that need to be consumed by external systems that have no need to interact with the TSR library itself should be written in the timeline-state-resolver-types package. Some types will be generated from JSON schemas, the schemas are composed under the $schemas subfolder in the specific integration's subfolder. (See the abstract integration for an example). The types can be generated with the `yarn generate-schema-types` command. The schemas themselves must be exported from the `src/manifests.ts` file, so they can be used by external systems to validate payloads and generate UI's.
